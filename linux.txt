By the help of Hans de Goede a linux compatible version of Mega Mario was created.
To play under linux you have to run the makefile located in the Megamario directory, just type :

> make PREFIX=/usr/local
> make PREFIX=/usr/local install


The libraries 

SDL 
SDL_image 
SDL_mixer 
SDL_ttf 

need to be installed!!!

It would be nice to have some feedback (forum, mail etc).
If there are problems, you also could contact hans for support <j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl>
